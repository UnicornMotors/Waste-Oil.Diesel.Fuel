Filtration: Ford fuel pumps have a Stainless steel mesh cap on them and a fabric "Strainer" on the plastic pickup/sending unit. This is perfect! Use one bare pump &amp; strainer to pump to a bucket drip through a finer large stainless meshthen use a 2nd pump &amp; strainer to send to final filtration material!
